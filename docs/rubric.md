They do not cover every requirement as more tests need to be written. We also have a lot of the front end done, so it looks nicer now than what he had thought. Everything currently runs, and build instructions are located in the README.md file. We are not completely done, as the owner page still needs to be implemented. Job assignment, job viewing, job completion, login, database, etc are all implemented and mostly functional.
