The project itself will be kept in the *app* folder.

## Version Control Procedures

We will be using git for version control on this project. We will meet up often to discuss changes that we make to the app, check up on what each of us is contributing, and resolve any conflicts (merge conflicts, disagreements about the direction we are taking the app, etc.).

Contributors will have access to David Storeyâ€™s repository, and will have access to commit, push, and pull as the development process demands. Branches should be committed and pushed, but not merged until they are reviewed in a team meeting.

## Tool Stack Description and Set Up Procedure

We will be using Django, a back-end python web framework, as the main framework for this project. Django will handle all of the back-end functions, including all database related actions. We will also utilize technologies such as CSS, HTML5, and JavaScript in conjunction with this framework.

We will use front-end frameworks like Bootstrap and Vue. These front end frameworks that will help us make the site look good. Bootstrap is good for mobile minded design, and Vue is lightweight and useful for a simpler design.
